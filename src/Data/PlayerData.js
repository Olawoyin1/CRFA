    bio : "Tobi is a no-nonsense defender, and there couldn’t be a better nickname for him than “Rudiger” Growing up, Tobi faced challenges that would have made many give up, but instead, they forged his character. Raised in one of the toughest neighborhoods, Tobi quickly learned that to succeed, he had to be strong and fearless. The rough games on makeshift pitches, where every tackle mattered and nothing came easy, shaped Tobi into the relentless force he is today. It was in those gritty games that he developed his trademark toughness—learning to stand his ground, make his presence felt, and protect his goal at all costs.\n\n On the pitch, Tobi is a warrior. He thrives on physical battles, and he’s never one to back down from a challenge. Whether it’s a crunching tackle, a fierce aerial duel, or throwing himself in front of a shot, Tobi lives for those moments. He plays with an intensity that inspires his teammates and strikes fear into opponents. His reputation as one of the toughest defenders in the league is well earned—strikers know that when they come up against Tobi, they’re in for a battle. But beyond his strength, there’s also an intelligence to his game. Tobi reads the play exceptionally well, anticipating runs and cutting off passes before they can develop into threats"

Nicknamed “BIG ENGINE” for his resilience and strength, Samson is the guy who does the dirty work. He breaks up attacks, makes crucial tackles, and puts his body on the line without a second thought. Samuel wasn’t the most gifted technically when he started, but through sheer determination and relentless hard work, he became indispensable. Off the field, he’s quiet, but his teammates know he’s the backbone of the squad. If you need someone to have your back, it’s Samson. \n\n On the field, Samson is the glue that holds everything together. He reads the game incredibly well, always in the right place at the right time to intercept a pass or block a shot. His tackling is fearless, and his physical presence is enough to intimidate even the most skillful attackers. Samson isn’t afraid to do the heavy lifting—winning the ball, making the gritty tackles, and covering every blade of grass. He’s the kind of player who doesn’t stop running, doesn’t stop fighting, and doesn’t stop believing until the final whistle blows. His work rate is unmatched, and that’s why he’s known as “Big Engine.” He just keeps going, driving the team forward when they need it most."

He thrives on finding spaces where none seem to exist, always one step ahead of the defenders trying to stop him. His close control of the ball, combined with a natural flair for dribbling, makes him one of the most difficult players to mark. Joshua is the player who keeps defenders up at night, wondering what he’ll do next. Whether it’s a deft touch to beat a man, a perfectly weighted pass, or a curling shot that leaves the keeper rooted, Joshua makes magic happen.\n\n Joshua’s vision on the pitch is almost otherworldly. He sees opportunities before anyone else, threading the ball through impossibly tight defenses with an almost effortless precision. It’s not just about scoring goals for Joshua—though he has a knack for finding the back of the net when it matters most—it’s about making his teammates better. He loves nothing more than providing that perfect assist, setting up a striker with a ball that begs to be finished. His unselfishness and willingness to work for the team make him a beloved figure both on and off the pitch."

His journey to the top wasn’t easy—he had to prove himself over and over again. But his passion and tireless effort earned him a spot, and he’s never looked back. Off the field, Taiwo is humble and soft-spoken, often surprising people who expect him to be as fierce as he is on the pitch. He’s a mentor to younger players, teaching them that hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard \n\n On the field, TAC is a dynamo, constantly in motion. He’s known for his uncanny ability to anticipate the flow of the game, darting into positions where he can disrupt the opposition or support his teammates. Whether it’s a last-ditch tackle to thwart a counterattack or a surging run into the opponent’s half to create a scoring opportunity, TAC is always involved. His commitment to the team is unwavering, and he’s often the first to arrive for training and the last to leave. Teammates respect him not just for his ability but for his work ethic—a living testament to the mantra that hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard."

Caleb lives for the moments that matter most.popularly Known as “Carlessi” for his lethal finishing, Peter has the ability to change a game in an instant. He’s the type of player who only needs one chance to score, and his calmness in front of goal is remarkable. Growing up, Peter was obsessed with watching tapes of his favorite strikers, studying their movements and mimicking their finishes. Now, he’s become that striker kids look up to. Off the field, Peter is a quiet soul, not one to seek the spotlight, but he lets his goals do the talking.  \n\n On the field, Caleb movements are calculated. He always seems to be one step ahead of the defenders, finding space where none seems to exist, ghosting into the box at just the right time. It’s this instinct that makes him so dangerous—he knows where to be, when to be there, and, most importantly, what to do when he gets there. His teammates trust him implicitly; when Caleb is in front of goal, there’s a sense of inevitability that the ball will find its way into the net."
